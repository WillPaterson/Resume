%	LETTER CONTENT
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{cvletter} 

I am excited to have the chance at gaining industry experience through \companyName. Currently, I am on track to graduate the University of Newcastle with a Bachelor of Software Engineering (Honours) in 2023. Throughout my university degree I have learnt Data Structures using C++, Algorithms though Java and some arm-based microprocessor coding though my elective pathway of Digital Electronics. I have also gained extensive experience with Web Technologies by creating multiple web-based individual and group projects. These projects have helped build strong teamwork and problem-solving skills on top of showing importance of version control.

Aside from my studies, I have held a long-term position at Williamtown McDonalds as Part-Time Overnight crew. This position has the unique challenge of requiring excellent time management with minimal crew. All while ensuring required tasks are completed to a high standard. In addition, working in a fast-paced team environment I have gained excellent team management and cooperation skills. Using these skills, I have helped mentor and train many crew members on correct and safe procedures. This position has help me develop my communication skill though interactions with crew members and customers.

While studying at high school, I attended two work placements to complete my Certificate 1 in Metals and Engineering. These experiences gave me valuable knowledge relating to the real-world metal working industry. This allowed me to put into context what I had learnt at school in relation to metal working. It is my hope that by performing industry experience through \companyName that I can also gain similar valuable knowledge into the workings of the real tech industry. This knowledge would greatly assist in grounding my future career as a dependable and hardworking software engineer.
